# Sentiment Analysis with NLTK

This project implements sentiment analysis using the Natural Language Toolkit (NLTK) library in Python. It allows users to classify the sentiment of textual data as positive, negative, or neutral, based on predefined datasets and models.
Features

    Text Preprocessing: Cleans and preprocesses raw text data by removing noise, stopwords, and performing tokenization.
    Sentiment Classification: Uses NLTK's sentiment analysis tools to classify text into positive, negative, or neutral sentiment.
    Custom Datasets: Supports custom datasets for training and testing the sentiment analysis model.
    Visualization: Displays results with visualizations, such as bar charts or word clouds, to provide better insights into sentiment distribution.

# Requirements

    Python 3.8+
    NLTK
    Other dependencies listed in requirements.txt. Install them with:

    bash

    pip install -r requirements.txt

# Installation

    Clone the repository:

    bash

git clone https://github.com/Sreejeet1998/Sentiment_Analysis_NLTK.git

Navigate to the project directory:

bash

cd Sentiment_Analysis_NLTK

Install the required dependencies:

bash

    pip install -r requirements.txt

Usage

    Data Preparation: Ensure you have a dataset in CSV or text format with labeled sentiments.
    Train the Model: Run the training script on your dataset to train the sentiment classifier:

    bash

python train_sentiment_model.py --data sentiment_data.csv

Analyze Sentiment: After training, you can analyze the sentiment of new text data:

bash

python analyze_sentiment.py --input new_text_data.txt

Visualization: Generate visualizations of the sentiment analysis results, such as:

bash

    python visualize_sentiment.py --data sentiment_results.csv

# Customization

You can customize the preprocessing steps, tweak the sentiment classifier, or try different models to improve the analysis. The project structure allows for easy modification of the sentiment analysis pipeline.
